                    <p>Having had interest in music from an early age, Sebastien soon found himself being employed within one of Paris' finest record stores, Dizonourd! While interest from the public eye has been volatile over the years he has seen a huge dip in attention which has been obviously brought on through the pandemic. "The thing is for someone that buys records, being able to physically browse through crate after crate of music is a release.

                    <p>The joy of finding that record you've been after for years or accidentally coming across something you
                        may not have come across online are just few of the reasons of what makes a record store such a valuable place for so many people worldwide. With restrictions, it became abundantly obvious that this ethos of music buying was severely under siege. Myself and John have thus decided creating an online repositary set up to fight this problem, to shine light on record stores across Europe in the hope of preserving a past-time that so many are found of."

                    <p>I would've had a slightly different patht to that of Conor. I had been running a series of parties in Barcelona for a number of years with live music and different types of music being played. I saw how tough these musicians and the surrounding music community had been experiencing things when the going wasn't too good. I decided to set up an online repositary that would help for those involved in the music community to seek out and find opportunites, clients and potential gigs.</p>

                    <p>That was all going fine but my message wasn't reaching as many people as I had originally intended. Upon meeting Conor at his record store in Paris, we began talking and exchanging our similiar stance on the idea that there was something problematic at hand. Through a few nights of brainstorming sessions, was born the idea of TurnStyle!
