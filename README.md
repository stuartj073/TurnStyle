<h1 class="center">TurnStyle</h1>
TurnStyle is a fictional website application set up to help advertise various record stores through trying times. 
By using a combination of social media, newspaper outlets and physical leaflets, TurnStyle hopes to ensure that those interested
in record stores are made aware of their existence and can in turn browse through their music catalogue (whether that be in person or online) ensuring
they are finacially supported through desperate times. TurnStyle sets out to ensure that artist's and musical venue's are supported and preserved
through also advertising them through the various different outlets as mentioned above. The pandemic has brought the world to it's knees and while those 
of us in office jobs are luckily able to continue to work at home, music stores, venues and artists are still plagued by the restrictions as imposed by each respective
constituency, being more than likely the last area of concern of governments with regard to opening up the economy. People involved in music are vital to any countries existing
cultural personality and that's why it's vital to ensure that we can do what we can to keep their existence ongoing as best as possible.

   ##Features##
        On each page of the website there were two common elements. The first being the header element which included the site logo
        and the navigation menu and the second being the footer which included the three different social media mediums through which to 
        get in contact with the business.

        To make the logo stand out and to give it more of a feeling I decided to use the 'Shadows Into Light Two' font-family.
        For the body, 'Gilda Display' was utilised. 

        Being concious of 'color-overload' I tried to use as little color I felt needed whilst also keeping in mind the design aspect of
        the website. The hex color #bebebe was utilised for the header and footer elements. The rgba color '(274, 171, 171, 0.9);' was used to give an
        opaque backdrop to push the site header and ethos. The hex color's '#f5f5f5', '#fafafa' and 'rgba(226, 217, 217, 0.9);' were used for the customer section,
        site information section and form section respectively.
