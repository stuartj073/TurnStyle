# TurnStyle
![GitHub Logo](/readme-files/amiresponsive.png)
TurnStyle is a fictional website application set up to help advertise various record stores through trying times. 
By using a combination of social media, newspaper outlets and physical leaflets, TurnStyle hopes to ensure that those interested
in record stores are made aware of their existence and can in turn browse through their music catalogue (whether that be in person or online) ensuring
they are finacially supported through desperate times. TurnStyle sets out to ensure that artist's and musical venue's are supported and preserved
through also advertising them through the various different outlets as mentioned above. The pandemic has brought the world to it's knees and while those 
of us in office jobs are luckily able to continue to work at home, music stores, venues and artists are still plagued by the restrictions as imposed by each respective
constituency, being more than likely the last area of concern of governments with regard to opening up the economy. People involved in music are vital to any countries existing
cultural personality and that's why it's vital to ensure that we can do what we can to keep their existence ongoing as best as possible.

## Features
On each page of the website there were two common elements. The first being the header element which included the site logo
and the navigation menu and the second being the footer which included the three different social media mediums through which to 
get in contact with the business.

To make the logo stand out and to give it more of a feeling I decided to use the 'Shadows Into Light Two' font-family.
For the body, 'Gilda Display' was utilised. 

Being concious of 'color-overload' I tried to use as little color I felt needed whilst also keeping in mind the design aspect of
the website. The hex color '#4d4c46' was utilised for the header and footer elements. The rgba color '(274, 171, 171, 0.9);' was used to give an
opaque backdrop to push the site header and ethos. The hex color's '#f5f5f5', '#fafafa' and 'rgba(105, 105, 105, 0.9)' were used for the customer section,
site information section and form section respectively. 

In terms of content per each page:
1. Home page: Included the site banner/title and ethos along with the site photo backdrop of a record store.
The 'Who we are' section essentially explains what the business is all about and how we go about doing exactly what we do. The 'How we do it' section goes into further detail explaining exactly how the business goes about carrying out it's mission statement in as much detail as possible. The social's, leaflet's and newspaper headings all work to show exactly how the business operates and works to put record store  owners and artists on the map.
Finally, the 'Who we help' section presents three quotes from fictional customers who have used the company in times gone by. This works to assure prospective customers that going into business with TurnStyle can work to be a safe bet.

2. About page: Gives a brief background of the two founder's of the business. Giving a more personal background of each owner works to give the customer a more personal connection with the site through its owners.
It also shows that the two owners are in fact music gurus with nothing but sheer passion and drive for the work they carry out.
3. Our Deals page: This page includes concise details of the two deals that prospective customer's may avail from if they decide
    to go into business with TurnStyle. The two deals include the 'basic' deal which is quite obviously the more standard deal of the two for business that may not need too much help but are still trying to put their business out there more so than it isn't at the moment. 
    The 'premium' deal outlines a more comprehensive package for those wanting to further their business' chances of survival in the longer term with more intensified help coming from the company.

4. Sign up page: The sign up page includes a sign up form for the customer allowing them to choose between the two deals and to 
    also include any relevant information that they feel might benefit their future relationship with TurnStyle.

### Features left to Implement

1. For the form's to be properly processed and for each user's form to be followed up by a verification email.
2. To actually make social media account's for the page so that it can communicate more clearly with it's users.
3. To include more 'real-life' stories from user's and their success in working with TurnStyle.
